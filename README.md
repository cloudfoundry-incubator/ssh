Diego-ssh is an implementation of an ssh proxy server and a lightweight
ssh daemon that supports command execution, secure file copies via
`scp`, and secure file transfer via `sftp`. When deployed and configured
correctly, these provide a simple and scalable way to access containers
associated with Diego long running processes.
